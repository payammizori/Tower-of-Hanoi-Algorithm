# Tower of Hanoi Algorithm

## Problem Statement

The Tower of Hanoi is a classical mathematical puzzle where the objective is to move a tower of N disks from the source peg to the destination peg, using an auxiliary peg, subject to certain constraints.

## Algorithm Overview

This algorithm solves the Tower of Hanoi iteratively using an explicit stack to simulate recursive calls. The state of the problem is represented by a structure (`HanoiState`), and a stack is used to manage the iterative process.
