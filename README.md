# Simple C++ Stack Implementation

This repository contains a basic implementation of a stack data structure in C++. The stack is a Last In, First Out (LIFO) data structure with essential operations such as push, pop, top, size, and display.

## Features

- **Push**: Add an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Remove the top element from the stack.
- **Top**: Display the top element of the stack.
- **Size**: Get the current size of the stack.
- **Display**: Show all elements in the stack.
